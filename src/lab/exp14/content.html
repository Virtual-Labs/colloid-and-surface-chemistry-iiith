Micelles which are aggregates of amphiphilic or amphipathic (surfactant) molecules find applications in many areas like chemistry, biology, pharmacy, and industry. When the concentration of an amphipathic or surfactant molecule in an aqueous solution is increased, above a particular concentration (or more precisely above a very narrow concentration range), molecular aggregates, called <i>micelles</i> begin to form. This concentration (or more precisely the narrow concentration range) is known as the <i>critical micelle concentration</i> (CMC). The CMC value in a given solvent is characteristic of the surfactant but depends on several other factors, because micellisation is influenced by thermal and electrostatic forces. Therefore, the values of CMCs depend on many factors like the carbon chain (tail) length, chain branching, number of C=C bonds, various types of additives, temperature and pressure. CMC decreases with increasing hydrocarbon chain-length. An addition of strong electrolyte to ionic surfactant tends to decrease the CMC. On the other hand, chain branching and addition of C=C bonds tend to increase the CMC. Determination of the CMC is important in order to understand the self-organizing behaviours of surfactants in solutions. The CMC is a useful physicochemical characteristic for many biologically active substances and drugs. Thermodynamic properties like standard Gibbs free energy change of micelle formation can be calculated if CMC values are known.

The formation of micellar aggregates causes significant changes in a number of physical and chemical properties of the system, such as surface tension, conductivity, fluorescence, pH, etc. (Figure 1). The rate of change of these properties with respect to the surfactant concentration show different trends above and below the CMC. This fact is exploited to follow the formation of micelles and to determine the CMC. Therefore, the determination of CMC essentially turns out to be the determination of the position of the breaking point in the concentration dependence of the selected physical or chemical property of the surfactant solution. Many techniques are available for the determination of the CMCs based on the measurements of surface tension, spectrophotometric, kinetics, conductivity, osmotic pressure, etc. as a function of surfactant concentrations. 
</p>
<p>
Ionic surfactant molecules at low concentrations act like normal electrolytes in aqueous solution but show different behaviour at or above the CMC. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), etc. dissociate in aqueous solutions into pairs of cation and anion where one of the ions is surface active and the other ion with opposite charge is called the counter ion. Thus, an aqueous ionic surfactant solution is like a normal electrolyte solution below the CMC. However, above the CMC when micellar aggregates form, a fraction of the counter ions bind to the aggregates and hence the mobility of such aggregates differs from that of their free monomeric ions. Therefore, electrochemical measurements like the electrical conductance (and specific conductance or conductivity) of ionic surfactant solutions with varying concentrations provide a simple method for the determination of CMCs in the cases of ionic surfactants. The specific conductance (κ) of the solution reflects the charge, mobility as well as the concentrations of all ions present in the solution.
</p>
<p>
κ=F Σ |z<sub>i</sub>|. u<sub>i</sub>. C<sub>i</sub> = Σλ<sub>i</sub> C<sub>i</sub>
</p>
<p>
where F is the Faraday constant (96,485 Coulomb/mol), λ<sub>i</sub> =F.z<sub>i</sub>.u<sub>i</sub> is the molar conductivity, z<sub>i</sub> is the charge, u<sub>i</sub> is the mobility, and C<sub>i</sub> is the molar concentration of ion, <i>i</i>. The specific conductance (κ) is calculated from the product of measured conductance (G) and the electrode cell constant (the ratio L/A, where L is the length of the separation between the electrodes and A is the common area of the electrodes).
</p>
<p>
κ = G x (L/A)
</p>
<p>
The value of the cell constant is determined by measuring the conductance of a standard solution of known specific conductance (conductivity). For example, the conductivity of a standard solution of 0.01 mol/L potassium chloride (KCl) is 0.0014088 mho.cm<sup>-1</sup> at 25°C.
</p>
<p>
If we assume that micelles do not exist below the CMC, then the addition of SDS causes an increase in charge carriers, Na<sup>+</sup>(aq) and CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>11</sub>OSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>(aq). Hence the conductivity (specific conductance), κ, of the surfactant solution below the CMC can be written as the sum of the conductivities of the ions produced by the dissociation of surfactant molecule. If one assumes that the aqueous surfactant solutions obey Kohlrausch's law, then the specific conductance, κ, of surfactant solutions can be written as:</p>
<p>
</p><center>κ = (λ<sub>S</sub> + λ<sub>DS</sub>) [SDS] = m<sub>1</sub> [SDS] (1)</center><p></p>
<p>where λ<sub>S</sub> is the ionic conductivity of sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>), λ<sub>DS</sub> the ionic conductivity of  dodecyl sulphate anion (CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>11</sub>OSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), [SDS] is the total SDS concentration, and m<sub>1</sub> is the slope of the plot of <i>κ</i> (specific conductance) vs. [SDS] below the CMC. Equation 1 shows the linear relationship between the conductivity and surfactant concentration below the CMC.</p>

<p>The conductivity of surfactant solutions at concentrations above the CMC is different from that below the CMC. Above the CMC, micellar aggregates form. Any further increase in surfactant concentration results in an increase in micelle concentration while the monomer concentration remains approximately constant at the CMC level. Thus, above the CMC, the monomers of concentration CMC as well as the micelles contribute to the conductivity. The dissociation of the molecules involved in forming the micelles is different from that of the monomer molecules. All the counter ions of the long chain ions involved in forming the micelles are not free for participation in electrical conductance due to their inclusion to the head group charge within the micelle. If α is the degree of micellar ionization (in other words, the fraction of surfactant molecules in the micellar aggregate that do not have bound counter ions), then the concentration of such micellar counter ions, S (Na+, in the case of the SDS surfactant) that participate in conductance is given by</p>

<p></p><center>[S] = α ([SDS] - CMC),</center><p></p>
<p>
Thus, one gets three different contributions to the conductivity of the solution above the CMC: (1) conductivity contributions from the ions of free monomers (of concentration = CMC), (2) conductivity from the charged micelles, and (3) the conductivity from the fraction of unbound micellar counter ions.</p>
<p>
The conductivity above the CMC is given by:
</p>
<p></p><center>κ = (λ<sub>S</sub> + λ<sub>DS</sub>). CMC + λ<sub>mic</sub> [micelles] +  λ<sub>S</sub> α ([SDS] - CMC) 		(2)</center><p></p>

<p>where [micelles] = ([SDS] - CMC)/N and N is the micelle aggregation number. If one assumes that the micelle conductivity is the same as the conductivity of all monomers with electrical charge in the micellar aggregate, then λ<sub>mic</sub> = a N. λ<sub>DS</sub> and eq. (2) is rearranged as:</p>
<p></p><center>κ = (λ<sub>S</sub> + λ<sub>DS</sub>)(1 - α). CMC + α  (λ<sub>S</sub> + λ<sub>DS</sub>)[SDS] = κ<sub>o</sub> + m<sub>2</sub> [SDS] 		(3)</center><p></p>
 
<p>where m<sub>2</sub> is the slope and κ<sub>o</sub> is the intercept of the linear plot of κ versus [SDS] above the CMC. Comparing eq. (1) and (3) one gets α = m<sub>2</sub>/m<sub>1</sub>, the ratio of the slopes of the straight lines obtained by plotting κ versus [SDS] above and below the CMC, respectively. The CMC value can be determined graphically as the intersection of the two straight lines defined by eqs. (1) and (3). The CMC can also be obtained from the intercept of the straight line obtained above CMC (eq 3). In this case one requires to divide the intercept (κ<sub>o</sub>) by (λ<sub>S</sub> + λ<sub>DS</sub>)(1 - α) where (λ<sub>S</sub> + λ<sub>DS</sub>) = m<sub>1</sub> and α = m<sub>2</sub>/m<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p>
The CMC value can also be determined graphically as the intersection of  the two straight lines obtained by plotting molar conductance, λ<sub>m</sub> versus √<span style="text-decoration: overline">C</span> (Kohlrausch Law, where C is the molar concentration), if the surfactant behaves as a strong electrolyte. Values of the molar conductance are calculated from the specific conductivity (κ) and the molar concentration of solution by using the relation, λ<sub>m</sub> = κ /C.</p>

<strong>To start the experiment do the following: </strong>
</p><ol>
<li>Determine the cell constant of the conductivity cell by calibration with two standard potassium chloride (0.10 M and 0.01 M) solutions. The value of the cell constant is determined by measuring the conductance of the standard solutions. The conductivities for 0.10 M and 0.01 M solutions are 0.012856 mho.cm<sup>-1</sup> and 0.0014088 mho.cm<sup>-1</sup> respectively at 25°C. Determine the mean cell constant. Here the cell constant of the cell was 1.1 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Note that the instrument readouts are in milli-mohs units.</li>

<li>All the solutions should be placed in a constant temperature bath maintained at 25°C for at least 20 minutes before measurements.</li>
<li>During measurement, one should take care so that no air bubbles remain trapped at the electrodes. If necessary, one has to shake the electrode gently to release the possible trapped air bubbles.</li>
<li>One has to use sufficient solution that allows full immersion of the electrodes portion of the conductivity cell in the solution.</li>
<li>After each measurement, the conductivity cell should be washed thoroughly and then be carefully dipped in a beaker containing deionized water. Before dipping the cell in the experimental solution, the water adhering to the cell should be soaked with the help of a piece of a lint free paper.</li>
<li>Prepare a 0.05 M stock solution of SDS (Mol. wt. = 288.38). SDS solution is prepared by weighing appropriate amount of SDS in an electronic or analytical balance. SDS should be weighed directly in an analytical flask. First dissolve the substance adding a small quantity of deionized water, and then it is fully dissolved by adding remaining volume of water. One must use only a very gentle mixing motion to avoid the foam formation.</li>
<li>All other solutions are prepared by exact dilution.</li>
<li>To measure the conductance at different concentrations of surfactant, prepare the most dilute solution first (see Table 1) and measure the conductance of the solution by dipping the cell in the experimental solution. Note down the reading after stabilization of the display on the instrument scale.</li>
<li>Repeat the measurement step 4 with next higher concentration. Carry out measurements always starting from the dilute sample to the next concentrated one. When proceeding to a new sample, rinse the beaker taking a small quantity of the solution whose conductance to be measured.  Thus perform the measurements with all the concentrations.</li>
<li>Plot specific conductance vs. SDS concentration graph and find out the intersection of the two straight lines and their slopes.</li>
<li>Determine CMC and the degree of micellar ionization.</li><li>Plot molar conductance vs. square root of SDS concentration and check whether SDS behave as strong electrolyte or not (Hint: Strong electrolyte gives a linear plot). Determine the CMC value from this plot?</li>
<li>Compare the CMC values found from this experiment with the literature data.</li><p>
